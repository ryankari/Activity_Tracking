# Activity Tracker

A Python desktop tool for analyzing and visualizing running activities using Garmin Connect data and AI-powered insights.

---

## Features

- Sync and analyze your Garmin running data
- Visualize metrics, splits, and training load (TSS, CTL, ATL)
- Chat with an AI coach (Ollama integration, streaming supported)
- Modern, user-friendly PyQt5 interface
- Modular codebase with clear separation of logic, plotting, AI, and styles

## Motivation

To provide athletes and endurance enthusiasts with a means of tracking our data and fitness over the long term.
While focused on Garmin, the intention is to retrieve data, store it locally, and provide an agnostic means of tracking and analyzing our data.
